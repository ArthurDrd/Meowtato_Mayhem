# Meowtato Mayhem !
You are four participants coming from distinct dimensions, engaging in a competition to attain the highest score or outlast the others. The objective is to transform into a potato to accumulate points, but you must exercise caution to avoid becoming excessively greedy, as doing so can result in you being consumed by flames. If your point total surpasses 100, the potato will detonate, leading to your demise. Consequently, you strive to become the potato to amass points while also striving not to be the potato to prevent accumulating an excessive number of points.

The winner will have their desire fulfilled, possibly even the opportunity to regain a human form.

Gameplay : Local mutiplayer (3 to 4 people recommended)
- The potato is transmitted in case of contact with another player.
- Move with WASD or with the controler joystick.

This game was made during the WonderJam Fall 2023  where the theme was : "Hot Potato".
